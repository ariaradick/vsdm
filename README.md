### DESCRIPTION: ##########################################################

VSDM is the Python implementation of the wavelet-harmonic integration method, designed for the efficient calculation of dark matter direct detection scattering rates in anisotropic detectors, and for arbitrary dark matter velocity distributions.

The code is still under development. Many of the components have been tested for accuracy, but no guarantee is made for the accuracy of the complete package.



#### Contents:
- source code, 'vsdm'
- a 'tools' directory includes several Jupyter notebooks, with examples of how to use VSDM, based on the results in arXiv:2310.01483
- 'tools/demo/', with CSV files of the wavelet-harmonic basis function coefficients for a toy velocity distribution ('gX') and momentum form factor ('fs2')
